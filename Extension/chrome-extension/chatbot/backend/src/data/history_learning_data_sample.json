A well-crafted URL can be a powerful tool to improve user experience, resulting in better search engine optimization (SEO) performance. Therefore, optimizing URLs can be a great way to boost your website’s rankings on search engine result pages (SERPs).\n\nThis article covers everything you need to know about what is a URL, from the definition to examples, its general structure, and how to custom-create URLs.\n\nDownload glossary for web beginners\n\nWhat Is a URL?\nWhat Is an Example of a URL Address\nWhat Is the Structure of a URL\nHTTP or HTTPS\nwww (Subdomain)\nDomain Name\nDomain Extension\nPath to the Resource\nParameters\nWhat Is a URL Syntax\nWhat Are the Different Types of URLs\nWhere Is a URL Located\nHow to Open a URL\nHow to Create a URL\nWhat Is a URL FAQ\nHow Do I Find My URL?\nHow to Block a URL?\nIs a URL the Same as an IP Address or a Web Address?\nWhat Is a URL?\n\nA URL, short for a uniform resource locator serves as a web address that guides users to specific resources on the internet, including domain names, paths, and protocol identifiers.\n\nWhat Is an Example of a URL Address\n\nHostinger’s complete URL is https://www.hostinger.com/ and entering it in a browser’s address bar directs users to our website. The same rule applies to https://www.microsoft.com/ and https://www.linux.org/.\n\nThat said, URLs can get more specific.\n\nFor example, the /tutorials/ URL leads users to our Tutorials page, and /tutorials/how-to-make-a-website is a full URL for our How to Make a Website article on Hostinger Tutorials.\n\nURLs can also send users to a particular section on a web page.\n\n/tutorials/how-to-make-a-website#6_Optimize_Your_Website_for_SEO_and_Conversions\n\nThe above URL, for example, sends users to the tip number 6 in the How to Make a Website article.\n\nLastly, every uploaded image has its own URL, enabling users to access it directly. The following URL leads to the featured image of our How to Make a Website article\n\n/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/how-to-make-a-website-1.png.\nWhat Is the Structure of a URL\n\nAs you can see from the image, uniform resource locator (URL) contains multiple parts.

From its inception in ancient rituals to the contemporary exchange of gifts and messages, we delve into the transformation of “what is the meaning of Valentine’s Day” and how it remains a significant part of our social fabric.\n\nKey Takeaways\nValentine’s Day has its origins in ancient Roman and Christian traditions, stemming from the Roman festival of Lupercalia and the actions of Saint Valentine, a third-century priest who defied the Emperor’s orders by marrying young lovers and left behind the enduring phrase, ‘From your Valentine’.\nThe holiday evolved from Middle Ages celebrations of courtly love to a commercialised phenomenon, largely influenced by literary figures like Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare, and the mass production of Valentine’s cards during the Victorian Era, with global spending reaching $23.9 billion in 2022.\nThe Roots of Valentine’s Day: Legends & Origins\n\nValentine’s Day, also called Saint Valentine’s Day, celebrated annually on February 14th, is steeped in ancient Roman and Christian traditions. The holiday has its origins in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, a celebration of fertility. The festival was later Christianised, aiming to replace pagan holidays with Christian feasts, leading to the establishment of Saint Valentine’s Day, now known as Valentine’s feast day, around mid-February.\n\nBut who was Saint Valentine? A priest from the third-century Roman Empire, he lived under Emperor Claudius II’s reign. Stories tell of Saint Valentine’s courageous defiance against the Emperor’s orders, continuing to marry young lovers. His legacy is enhanced by the love letter he penned following his capture and signed as ‘From your Valentine’, a phrase persisting in today’s celebrations, symbolising love and sacrifice.\n\nNotably, mid-winter celebrations of love and fertility weren’t exclusive to ancient Rome. Ancient Greece also hosted a corresponding festival, honouring the marriage of Zeus and Hera. This suggests a widespread cultural practice of love and fertility festivals around the same time of the year, possibly influence",

We start by understanding what semantic search is, how vectors represent meaning, and why vector databases like Qdrant are essential for fast and efficient similarity search. We also highlight the advantages of vector databases and break down the key components of vector search in Qdrant. Finally, we dive into a real-world implementation, building a customer support and ticket resolution system, where we store past support tickets as vector embeddings and create a semantic search engine to retrieve relevant solutions instantly.\n\nWhat is Semantic Search\n\nSemantic search is a search technique that improves accuracy by understanding the intent and contextual meaning of a query rather than relying only on exact keyword matching.\n\nWhat is Vector\n\nA vector is a mathematical representation of an object or data point in a multi-dimensional space. Each element of a vector corresponds to a specific feature or attribute of the object it represents.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn image recognition, a vector could represent an image, with each element corresponding to pixel values or extracted visual features.\nIn natural language processing (NLP), a vector might represent a sentence, with elements capturing semantic meaning, word embeddings, or sentiment.\nIn music recommendation systems, a vector could represent a song, with elements describing tempo, genre, lyrics.\n\nVectors allow complex data types like text, images, audio, and video to be represented numerically, enabling machines to process and compare them efficiently.\n\nWhat is the role of Vector Database\n\nA Vector Database is a specialized type of database designed to store, manage, and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. Unlike traditional relational databases that organize data in rows and columns, vector databases store data as collections of high-dimensional vectors along with metadata.\n\nDifference between Vector Database and RDMS\nKey Distance Metrics in VectorDBs:\n\nVector databases use mathematical distance functions to measure similarity:\n\nCosine Similarity — Measures the angle between two vectors; useful for text similarity.\nDot Product — Considers both the magnitude and direction; useful in recommendation systems.\nEuclidean Distance — Measures straight-line distance; useful for spatial or numerical data.\nAdvantages of Vector Databases:\nEfficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data.\nFast real-time similarity searches across billions of vectors.\nSupport for unstructured data like images, videos, and natural language.\nReduces the need for custom-built similarity search solutions.\nEssential Qdrant Concep",

Usually those quantities can't be expressed using a single number (a scalar). Imagine an arrow connecting an initial point A with a terminal point B. This arrow represents a vector, and it’s what you need to \"carry\" point A to point B. In simple words, a vector is like an arrow. You can use the arrow to learn where things are in a space, and the arrow shows both the distance and the direction.\n\nA vector space is a set of vectors that can be played with each other. You can add or multiply them, but need to follow some certain rules.\n\nWhat is a vector's dimension?\n\nTo better describe a vector, we need to understand what does dimension mean. A dimension is a way to describe how many directions something can be measured. In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. A line has a dimension of one (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it – for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface, such as the boundary of a cylinder or sphere, has a dimension of two (2D). Because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on the surface. For example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. In a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional (3D). Because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.\n\nWhat is a high-dimensional vector?\n\nA high-dimensional vector is like a long arrow. The arrow points in many different directions at once (hard to imagine). Each direction represents a different feature or aspect of something.\n\nLet's say we have a vector that represents a picture of a dog. In a low-dimensional vector, we might only have a few directions representing basic features like color and type. But in a high-dimensional vector, we could have hundreds or even thousands of directions. Those directions represent features. Like the shape of the dog ears, the color of the eye, the texture of its fur and so on.\n\nSo, a high-dimensional vector is like a detailed description of something. The description contains different aspects or features and was packed into one long arrow (a heavy arrow as well). These high-dimensional vectors are used in things like machine learning and data analysis to capture complex informati",

It is a structured, hierarchical approach as opposed to naive semantic-search approaches using plain text snippets. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll walk through the process of setting up and using GraphRAG with open-source inference alternatives like vLLM for inferencing our Large Language Model and Ollama for embeddings.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, ensure you have:\n\nA system with NVIDIA GPUs\nPython 3.10–3.11 ( vLLM supports 3.8 to 3.11 || GraphRAG supports 3.10 and above)\nPatience, as some steps can be time-consuming\nSetting Up the Environment\n\nWe’ll start by creating a fresh environment for our GraphRAG setup. You can use either Conda or Python’s built-in venv. Given that will be required to install CUDA as well, let’s proceed ahead with conda for easy setup.\n\nconda create --name graphenv python=3.11 -y && conda activate graphenv\n\nNote: We are using Python 3.11 because of vLLM compatibility.\n\nInstalling GraphRAG\n\nOnce your environment is set up, install GraphRAG:\n\npip install graphrag==0.1.1 ollama\nPreparing the Workspace\n\nCreate a directory for your RAG project:\n\nmkdir -p ./ragdir/input\n\nNow add the text file inside the input directory. Keep the text content very short because GraphRAG is computationally expensive and it will take time for indexing.\n\nInitializing the GraphRAG workspace:\npython -m graphrag.index --init --root ./ragdir\n\nThis will create two files: .env and settings.yaml in the ./ragdir directory.\n\n.env contains the environment variables required to run the GraphRAG pipeline. If you inspect the file, you'll see a single environment variable defined, GRAPHRAG_API_KEY=<API_KEY>. This is the API key for the OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI endpoint.\nsettings.yaml contains the settings for the pipeline. You can modify this file to change the settings for the pipeline.\nConfiguring GraphRAG\n\nModifying .env\nReplace the API key in .env with:\n\nGRAPHRAG_API_KEY=EMPTY\n\nUpdating settings.yaml\nModify these four changes in settings.yaml to use vLLM and Ollama:\n\nllm: \n  api_base: http://localhost:8000/v1 \n  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \nembedding:\n  llm:\n    model: nomic-embed-text \n    api_base: http://localhost:11434/api\n\nvLLM runs on a default port of 8000 and ollama on 11434.\n\nI will soon explain why we are making these changes. But for the time being, let’s continue with the setup.\n\nSetting up vLLM\n\nvLLM requires CUDA 12.1 for its compiled binaries. Let’s set it up:\n\nCheck and install the NVIDIA drivers\n\nFirst, check your driver version of NVIDIA and its CUDA compatibility:\n\nnvidia-smi\nIf you’re not seeing any output, you need to first install the driver",

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is an instance of Shallow Semantic Analysis.\n\nIn a sentence :\n\nA predicate states a property or a characterization of a subject, such as what it does and what it is like.\nThe predicate represents the core of an event, whereas the words accompanying the predicate are arguments.\nA semantic role refers to the abstract role an argument of a predicate take on in the event, including agent, patient, theme, experiencer, beneficiary, instrument, location, goal, and source.\n\nConsider an example of semantic role labeling below :\n\nHere the predicate (verb) is leave\nThe object of leave is ‘Lansky ‘(A student)\nThe source from where she left is ‘Australia’\nThe purpose of leaving is to ‘study the Piano at Royal College of Music’\nApplications of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) :\n\nSRL is useful as an intermediate step in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as information extraction, automatic document categorization, question answering etc.\n\nSRL System Implementation\n\nSRL is considered as a supervised machine learning problem. In traditional methods , linear classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM were often employed to perform this task based on features extracted from the training corpus.\n\nSyntactic information is considered to play an essential role in solving this problem. The location of an argument on syntactic tree provides an intermediate tag for improving the performance. However building this Syntactic tree also introduces prediction risk inevitably. The analysis in (Pradhan et al. 2005) fount that the major source of the incorrect predictions was the syntactic parser.\n\nTo overcome this problem, (Collobert et al., 2011) proposed a unified neural network architecture using word embeddings and convolution. However they had to resort to parsing features in order to make the system competitive.\n\nSRL using Deep Learning\n\nThis post i wanted to introduce the new neural network which has given very good results on semantic role labeling\n\nIt is an end-to-end system using bi-directional long short-term memory (DB-LSTM) which was presented in :\n\nEnd-to-end learning of semantic role labeling using recurrent neural networks (Zhou & Xu International joint conference on Natural Language Processing, 2015 )\n\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) has advantage in modeling sequencing problems. The past information is built up through the recurrent layer when model consumes the sequence word by word.\n\nPeople often met with two difficulties with RNN :\n\nInformation of the current word strongly depends on distant words, rather than its neighborhood.\nGradient parameters may explode or vanish especially in processing long sequences (Bengio et al. 1994) .\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)",

This has happened twice in the last three months. Each time, the application fails to connect for a while, then recovers on its own.\n\nOur Cloud SQL instance is not in High Availability (HA). We would like to understand the possible causes of these intermittent disconnections and how to mitigate them.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar issues?

It's at 145, so we know it's coming down,\" he said, referring to the new import taxes of up to 145% imposed on China since he returned to the White House.\n\nTrump made the comments during an event to unveil a tariffs deal with the UK - the first such agreement since he hit countries around the world with steep levies in April.\n\nThe meeting in Switzerland this weekend is the strongest signal yet that the two sides are ready to deescalate a trade war that has sent shockwaves through financial markets.\n\n\"I think it's a very friendly meeting. They look forward to doing it in an elegant way,\" Trump said of the talks with China.\n\nChina's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the talks, saying Beijing has \"full confidence\" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US.\n\nOfficials in both Washington and Beijing are \"under growing economic pressure\", Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC.\n\n\"The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table\", she added.\n\nThe announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations.\n\n\"The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon,\" said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson.\n\nAny cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be \"minor\", he added.\n\nThe initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng.\n\nBut \"I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents,\" Mr Olson said.\n\nAnother trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome.\n\n\"A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions\", the former head of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News.\n\nOn Friday, official figures for April showed China's exports to the US fell by more than 20% compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1%.\n\nWatch: US and China are ready to talk tariffs - who will blink first?\n\nThe talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became",

For example, if you're describing a chart that shows percentages of poverty, you might think that you need to use synonyms of the word poverty in your answer.\n\nIf you look for synonyms of 'poverty' in a dictionary, you'll find words like:\n\ndestitution, pennilessness, deprivation, impoverishment, pauperism\n\nUnfortunately, these words will seem forced and unnatural. Also, you don't have access to a dictionary in your test, and it's unlikely that you would have these words in your head.\n\nMy advice in the video lesson was this: Add variety by using collocations instead of synonyms. For example:\n\nCollocations with the word poverty:\n\npoverty rates\nlevels of poverty\nbelow the poverty line\n\nCollocations with the adjective (poor) instead of the noun (poverty):\n\npoor people\npeople who were classed as poor\npoorer individuals\n\nIn the academic test, this is the best way to reduce repetition and to add variety to your task 1 answers.\n\nComments\n\n You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.\n\nOk\n\nPosted by: IKENNA HYACINTH NWOBODO | November 14, 2019 at 22:03\n\nCan I use these phrases when referring to the poor?\n\n- poor members of society\n- the marginalized group\n- financially challenged individuals\n- people living below the poverty line\n- poverty-stricken individuals/people/society\n- destitute people/individuals\n\nPosted by: Yves | November 15, 2019 at 08:30\n\nYves,\n\nHere's what I advise:\n\n- poor members of society - YES\n- the marginalized group - NO\n- financially challenged individuals - NO\n- people living below the poverty line - YES\n- poverty-stricken individuals/people/society - YES\n- destitute people/individuals -NO\n\nPosted by: Simon | November 15, 2019 at 08:53\n\nI wonder whether the following phrases of poor and poverty are correct to use in Task 1\n\n- people from poor background\n- people with financial hardship\n- deprived people\n- people from poor area\n- people who are on social benefits\n\nThanks\n\nPosted by: Sajan | November 15, 2019 at 10:10\n\nThe comments to this entry are closed.",

It is recognised by more than 10,000 universities, schools, employers and immigration bodies, including all universities in Australia and the UK and many of the leading institutions in the USA.\n\nEstablished in 1989, and jointly owned by the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge Assessment English, IELTS is now a household name in many countries around the world. \n\nWarwick Freeland, Managing Director at IDP IELTS Australia said: “IELTS opens doors for millions of people every year, helping them to study abroad, migrate to English-speaking countries or take advantage of the growing need for English in professional life.” \n\nThe success of IELTS rests on the high quality of the test, which measures the four key languages skills – listening, speaking, reading and writing. It is backed by dedicated research teams in the UK and Australia, and administered by centres in more than 140 countries around the world.\n\nJames Shipton, Head IELTS at the British Council, said: “The continued growth of IELTS that we’ve seen around the world is testament to the popularity of the test with test takers, and to the trust that organisations place in IELTS to provide scores that are a reliable indicator of a person’s ability to communicate in English.”\n\n Previous: IELTS Simon - one of the best websites for IELTS Preparation\nNext: IELTS Remark - What you should know and what you should do \nShare with friends\nCopy\nRelated IELTS Tips\nView more\nIELTS online courses\nImprove your English and prepare for tests, such as IELTS reading, writing,...\nAnnouncements\n24,659\nAll IELTS Explained Videos are OFF 50% in May 2020 ONLY\nAs you know, we're experiencing a change to our way of lives that nobody...\nAnnouncements\n2,356\nIELTS testing resumes in 39 countries\nThe IELTS partners very much appreciate your support and patience during...\nAnnouncements\n1,118\nInterGreat Education Group: An Official IELTS Registration Centre and Platinum Member of the British Council Partnership Programme\nWe are thrilled to announce that InterGreat Education Group has been recognized...\nAnnouncements\n77,664\nSome new features in our website this month\nWe want to enhance the user experience in writing and speaking test module...\nAnnouncements\n763\nIELTS Model Answer of Band 7\nIELTS Model Answer of Band 7 It is often seen quite commonly...\nAnnouncements\n27,450\nComments:\nPost a comment on \"I",

But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\n\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\n\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\n\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\n\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains – all for around €150,000 (£127,000/$170,000) per person.           \n\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy – inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\n\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect – it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia – a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen – by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body.

A cryptic forum thread. A generation of frightened children. This is the story of Ben Drowned – the internet's most infamous video game ghost.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve and 10-year-old Saarthak Johri couldn't sleep – but not because of excitement. He was shot through with fear. It was roughly a decade ago and Johri was a kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, in the US. He had spent the day slumped in an easy chair, staring at his phone, totally absorbed in an online urban myth. Johri knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. And yet, he was powerless to get it out of his mind.\n\nHe had found a trail of old forum posts supposedly written by a college student. The student, who used the online pseudonym Jadusable, had bought a strange copy of a Nintendo 64 video game at a yard sale. It was The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a notoriously dark instalment in the Zelda franchise, released 25 years ago this week on 27 April 2000.\n\nMajora's Mask is full of unnerving discussions about death, denial, fear, regret – and a looming apocalypse. But something was off about the cartridge Jadusable found. It had no label, just \"Majora\" scribbled on the plastic in marker. And something was seriously wrong with it.\n\nJadusable wrote that the game's familiar graphics were strange and distorted. Music played backwards in a spine-chilling loop. Worst of all, he was plagued by a terrifying statue of the main character, Link, with a petrified grimace on its face. It kept appearing in the game out of nowhere – like a digital ghost. On YouTube, Jadusable posted video evidence of everything he had described. This game cartridge, it seemed, was haunted – inhabited by the spirit of its former owner, a child named Ben who had drowned in a tragic accident. Johri pored over every detail, rapt with morbid curiosity.\n\nAs the story unfolded through roughly 11,000-words of forum entries posted over the course of weeks, Jadusable described a haunting that soon extended beyond the game to other areas of his life. Eventually, after a series of increasingly disturbing experiences, the forum posts ceased, and Jadusable was never heard from again. This urban legend burst onto the web in 2010, traumatising a generation of young internet users. It became known as \"Ben Drowned\".\n\nBen Drowned left an indelible mark on the web and continues to spawn art and fan fiction long after it emerged. Though lesser-known outside gaming circles, the story and its accompanying videos racked up millions of views and have inspired other narratives in a similar vein.\n\nAt its core, Ben Drowned is a story about a ghost in a machine – one that speaks to our deepest fears about new technology. But it's more than an ",

The excitement runs high as large, painstakingly decorated lantern floats are paraded through towns, followed by lighting portable shrines on fire, or throwing them into the sea. The fire is believed to burn away people's troubles and misfortunes.\n\nDon't Miss\nThe beautiful, intricately designed floats\nLively parades of lanterns and portable shrines\nThe fiery climax\nHow to Get There\n\nThe festivals are held all over the Noto Peninsula \n in different towns and cities. Kanazawa \n is the main transport hub in Ishikawa \n, with trains and buses serving the peninsula. Light traffic and scenic coastal roads make the peninsula an ideal driving destination.\n\nTo access the peninsula by rail, take the JR Nanao Line from Kanazawa Station \n. The journey to Wakura Onsen takes an hour by express train. Local lines continue from Wakura Onsen as far north as Anamizu.\n\nFor Wajima, on the northern tip of the peninsula, take the Hokutetsu express bus from Kanazawa. Expect the journey to take a little over two hours.\n\nFrom Tokyo's Haneda Airport \n, there are direct flights to Noto Airport, in the center of the peninsula. From there you can rent a car or catch a bus to Wajima or Anamizu.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nThe first Noto Kiriko festivals were held in the late 17th century\n\nKiriko means “sacred lantern”\n\nIshikawa's greatest summer festivals\n\nThere are multiple Kiriko festivals held during this season, and you can see one virtually every weekend. No festival is quite the same, with each community having its own customs and traditions.\n\nIntricately decorated floats\n\nKiriko toro, or simply kiriko as they are commonly called, are the large illuminated lantern floats carried during the Noto Kiriko summer festivals. The smaller floats are carried by children, and larger ones—reaching up to up to 15 meters tall—are carried by young adults.\n\nThe floats are often decorated with gold leaf and carvings on the upper part of the roof, and the lanterns are painted with Japanese characters and illustrations.

The festival turns the city into a huge party, especially during the two periods in mid-July when elaborately-decorated multi-ton floats are displayed and then pulled through the streets.\n\nIf you hope to attend this wildly popular festival, make sure to reserve your accommodation months in advance.\n\nDon't Miss\nThe Yoiyama evening street parties on the three days preceding the parades\nFamily heirlooms displayed during the Byobu Matsuri\nWatching the giant floats execute hair-raising turns\nSoaking up the atmosphere with the locals in yukata, and snacking on street food\nHow to Get There\n\nThe Gion Matsuri takes place in central Kyoto and can be easily accessed by subway, bus, taxi or on foot.\n\nThe main celebrations of the festival are centered around Shijo, Kawaramachi, and Oike streets. It is relatively easy to find a spot to watch the parade from along the route, provided you pay attention to potential road closures.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nGion Matsuri is held over a period of one month in July\n\nThe main processions take place on July 17 (Saki Matsuri Junko) and July 24 (Ato Matsuri Junko)\n\nThe biggest floats in the parade are known as yamaboko and weigh up to 12 tons\n\nThe origins of the festival\n\nThe Gion Matsuri began in 869 as a way to appease the gods during an epidemic. Every year, as per tradition, a local boy is chosen as a sacred messenger to the gods. From July 13 until the first parade ends on July 17, he sits on one of the many elaborate floats and his feet never touch the ground.\n\nA float at Gion Matsuri\n\nGion's gorgeous floats\n\nThere are two types of floats at the Gion Festival: yama and hoko. Hoko can be up to 25 meters tall and weigh up to 12 tons. Both yama and hoko are elaborately decorated and adorned with exquisite craftwork such as woven fabric, dyed textiles and sculptures. They are so beautiful that they are sometimes referred to as \"mobile art museums.\" There are two processions during the festival when the floats are paraded through downtown Kyoto from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The largest of the two is on July 17 with 23 floats, and the second on July 24 with",

Matcha Lattes can be made hot and cold! If you’re missing your usual iced matcha latte from Starbucks or your neighborhood coffee shop, this recipe is for you! As a result, you’ll be able to make your favorite drink at home! And make this Strawberry Matcha version too!\n\nTable of Contents\nWhat is Matcha?\nHow to Make Iced Matcha Latte\nSTEP 1:\nVIEW MORE →\n\nI love making coffee shop drinks at home. Everything from cozy Pumpkin Spice Lattes, Iced Pumpkin Spice Lattes, Gingerbread Lattes, Horchata Coffee to Mint Vanilla Iced Coffee.\n\nIn the afternoon, around 3pm, I get SUPER sleepy. I need a pick me up. And that pick me up during warmer weathered months is this: an Iced Matcha Latte.\n\nAnd in the afternoon when I need a bit of a pick-me-up and know I can’t handle coffee or an espresso beverage (I’ll be up all night), a matcha latte is the perfect go-to.\n\nWhat is Matcha?\n\nMatcha powder is made up of ground up green tea leaves. Instead of brewing a cup of tea with tea leaves, this is ground up leaves that are dissolved into the warm/hot water. If you ever have the privilege of visiting Kyoto, Japan, be sure to go to a tea house and buy some beautiful matcha green tea powder for the road. The packets make great gifts.\n\nThis Matcha Iced Latte couldn’t be simpler. As a result, it’s the perfect thing to make at home!\n\nHow to Make Iced Matcha Latte\nSTEP 1:\n\nYou put a few teaspoons of matcha powder in a measuring cup and add a few tablespoons of hot water.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nWhisk it until the matcha has dissolved and then you pour in the remaining water and whisk some more. I transfer it to the fridge or freezer to chill for about 15 minutes.\n\nI know the cooling part is a drag but it helps a whole lot in the end result.\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nAfter the matcha is cooled, add a ridiculous amount of ice to a glass. And then, pour the almond milk (or milk of choice) into the glass and a splash of simple syrup. Lastly, pour in the matcha. As a result, there is unbridled happiness!\n\nI mean…this isn’t really a recipe but more of an idea of inspiration? (I hope…?)\n\nMilk Options for an Iced Matcha Latte\nSoy milk\nOat milk\nAlmond milk\nWhole milk\nRecipe FAQs\nWhere does matcha come from?\n\nMatcha comes from Kyoto, Japan.\n\nIs matcha bitter or sweet?\nWhat to Serve with an Iced Matcha Latte\n\nBREAKFAST\n\nolive oil fried eggs\n\nBREAKFAST\n\nbreakfast burritos\n\nBREAKFAST\n\ncinnamon swirl bread\n\nDESSERTS\n\napple cheese danish\n\nIf you tried this  Iced Ma",

It’s loaded with good-for-you benefits, simple to make, and energizing in the best way possible – without the 3pm caffeine slump! \n\nThis easy matcha tea only requires two ingredients – matcha powder and hot water. It’s the traditional recipe that’s enjoyed in Japan, with lots of frothy little bubbles on top. \n\nPOPULAR RIGHT NOW\n\nMatcha has a grassy, umami flavor and some may consider it an acquired taste, though I personally love it. If you’d like to ease into the flavor of matcha, you can always add a little sweetener to this tea. You can also make a matcha latte with foamed milk or even sneak the matcha powder into homemade snacks, like my matcha pistachio bliss balls.  \n\nBut the best part about matcha is that it contains a bunch of health benefits, from being a powerful antioxidant and detoxifier to giving you a calm yet energizing boost throughout the day. So if you’re looking for the next star ingredient to incorporate into your routine, give matcha a try! \n\nMATCHA TEA INGREDIENTS\nMatcha powder: I use an organic ceremonial grade matcha (more on that below), like Jade Leaf Matcha or Ippodo Tea Matcha. \nHot water: You want hot, but not boiling water for this recipe. 175°F is perfect! \nOptional Sweetener: Feel free to add honey, maple syrup, or another sweetener to your liking. \n\nFind the printable recipe with measurements below\n\nDIFFERENT GRADES OF MATCHA POWDER\n\nShopping for matcha powder can be overwhelming, but there are two main types – ceremonial grade and culinary grade. Here’s a quick summary and how they should be used:\n\nCeremonial Grade is the highest quality matcha and most expensive. It’s made from young matcha leaves that have been shaded for longer with stems removed to improve its naturally sweet flavor and radiate an electric green color. This is what’s used in traditional Japanese tea ceremonies and is best enjoyed on its own.\nCulinary Grade is a bit lower in quality and price. But this makes",

Many opt to skip it entirely. \"No one reads GDDs anyway.\" \"They become outdated the minute you finish writing them.\"\n\nThey are not entirely wrong. Rigid, multi-page GDDs have no place in modern game development. But it doesn't mean that game design documentation has become obsolete – it has merely evolved.\n\nLet's dive deeper into what a modern video game design document is and how to write it.\nOr skip directly to the GDD template.\n\nWhat is a game design document (GDD)?\nHow to write a GDD\nGame design document template\nReal-life GDD examples\nWhat is a game design document (GDD)?\n\nA game design document (GDD) is a software design document that serves as a blueprint from which your game is to be built. It helps you define the scope of your game and sets the general direction for the project, keeping the entire team on the same page.\n\nUse this GDD template\n\nA GDD usually includes:\n\nExecutive summary (game concept, genre, target audience, project scope, etc.)\n\nGameplay (objectives, game progressions, in-game GUI, etc.)\n\nMechanics (rules, combat, physics, etc.)\n\nGame elements (worldbuilding, story, characters, locations, level design, etc.)\n\nAssets (music, sound effects, 2D/3D models, etc.)\n\nHere's an example of a game design document created in Nuclino, a unified workspace where teams can bring all their knowledge, docs, and projects together:\n\nGame design document example (Artwork credit: Stephane Wootha Richard)\n\nNuclino can serve as a lightweight game documentation tool, a game development planner, an internal wiki, and more. You can create real-time collaborative docs, allowing you to document, share, and collaborate on anything, from game proposals and storyboards to character profiles and concept art.\n\nVisual collaboration is seamlessly built into Nuclino. You can add an infinite collaborative canvas anywhere and create diagrams and whiteboards directly within your design document, without switching tools.\n\nYou can use it to visualize your game's core gameplay loop, capture different mechanics and interaction flows, brainstrom ideas using sticky notes, organize concept art, and more.\n\nNuclino can be integrated with a wide range of other tools, including Discord, Google Drive, Slack, and more, seamlessly integrating it into your game design process.\n\nNuclino also comes with an AI-powered assistant called Sidekick that can help game designers with various aspects of the creative process. With Sidekick, you can generate ideas for characters and plot points, instantly create de",

Ensure the seeds are covered with soil and lightly watered, then place the container in a warm, sunny spot to germinate, notes the RHS. \nDetailed Steps:\n1. Choose the Right Seeds:\nSelect vegetable varieties that are suited to the Japanese climate and your specific growing conditions, suggests the Japan Simple Life forum. \n2. Prepare the Soil:\nLoosen the soil and remove any debris. Mix in compost or other organic matter to improve drainage and fertility, as recommended by mottainai-transition.com. \n3. Create Furrows:\nUse a hoe or rake to create shallow furrows in the soil, as described by Auckland Botanic Gardens. \n4. Sow the Seeds:\nSpace the seeds appropriately according to the instructions on the seed packet. Sow at a depth of about twice the seed size, according to Auckland Botanic Gardens. \n5. Cover and Water:\nGently cover the seeds with soil and lightly water the area, as suggested by the RHS. \n6. Provide Warmth and Light:\nPlace the container or garden bed in a warm, sunny spot to encourage germination, notes the RHS. \n7. Maintain Moisture:\nKeep the soil consistently moist but not soggy, as explained by Savvy Tokyo. \n8. Thinning:\nOnce the seedlings emerge, thin them out if necessary to provide adequate spacing for growth. \n9. Transplanting:\nIf you are starting seeds indoors, transplant the seedlings to their permanent location once they are strong enough and the weather is suitable, as explained by 三菱マヒンドラ農機. \nAdditional Tips for Success:\nSeed Soaking: Some seeds, like beans and peas, benefit from soaking before planting to help with germination, notes Local Food Connect. \nHill Method: For certain vegetables, like tomatoes, the hill method (creating mounds of soil) can be effective for drainage and growth, as explained by Fine Gardening. \nVariety Selection: Choose varieties that are well-suited to your climate and growing conditions, recommends the Japan Simple Life forum. \nPest and Disease Control: Be vigilant for pests and diseases and take appropriate action early on. \nComposting: Use compost to enrich the soil and provide nutrients for your plants. \nSeeding time - Japan Simple Life\nWe do carrots outside.

In fact, you don’t need ANY yard to begin growing your own food from home. When I moved to my new home in Tokyo about a year ago, I knew that I wanted to try growing my own fruits and vegetables, but I wasn’t sure how successful I’d be with a small balcony and patio.\n\nDespite being a complete beginner and just following my intuition, I managed to have some pretty successful yields. I was able to grow strawberries, tomatoes, bell peppers, chili peppers, eggplants, spinach, potatoes, and more all on my first try! Just look at some of the results:\n\nPeppers, spinach, and tomatoes I grew in Tokyo!\n\nIt took quite a bit of time (and money) investment, but it was so satisfying to look out the window and see my garden flourish and grow bit by bit each day. Sure I could have bought all of these from the supermarket with a lot less effort if I wanted to, but it was so rewarding being able to prepare meals with the fruits and vegetables I grew and picked on my own.\n\nObviously, one year of gardening does not make me an expert. I still very much consider myself a beginner. I have, however, learned quite a bit over my year of mishaps and would like to share that information with other people living in Tokyo, Japan or other cities around the world.\n\nWith a little bit of sunshine and space you can start your own garden and I’m going to try my best to share how!\n\nInformation You’ll Need Before Starting Your Garden\nVarious pots we tried while getting started.\n\nFirst and foremost, you just need some clear space (big or small). It doesn’t matter if it’s a balcony, patio, or even rooftop. Take a good look at the space you want to start your garden in and jot down the measurements. You’ll need to know how big it is to determine what size pots will work the best.\n\nHow much ground space do you have?\nHow thick are the rails on your balcony?\nHow much space is usually left under your laundry if you hang it outside?\nCan you hang additional poles on your laundry rack?\n\nNext, you’ll want to take note of how water will drain from the space.\n\nWhere is the drain located?\nHow quickly does it drain?\nIs it clogged?\nCan soil drain through it without causing any issues for you or your neighbor?\n\nLastly, you’ll need to get a good idea of how much sunlight the space typically gets.\n\nDoes it get direct or indirect sunlight?\nHow many hours of sunlight does it usually get in a day?\nIs there anything you can move to increase the sunlight exposure?\nIs the sunlight exposure better in some spots than others?\n\nNow that you have a good idea of what your gardening space is like, let’s take a look at some of the supplies you’ll need to start planting!\n\nWild strawberries can be grown in small pots!\nSupplies You’ll Need to Get Started\n\nIt doesn’t take a",

But there are any good reasons why you should be considering it.\n\nFirst of all, it allows you to eat healthy organic fruits and vegetables, which have not been sprayed with pesticides, for very little money.\n\nBesides, in a country like Japan, where natural disasters can occur at any time, it allows you to build your food self-sufficiency.\n\nJon Walsh, an urban farming and sustainability instructor and consultant based in Tokyo, who we had the chance to interview for our first episode of “Conversations with Green Changemakers in Japan”, is sharing with us his top 5 tips to get started with urban farming. \n\nIf you want to know more about urban farming and how to grow your own food, do not hesitate to send him an email at businessgrow@hotmail.com.\n\n1/ Find the best place to grow your plants\n\nShade is the main issue when living in the city as it can be challenging to grow food if they don’t get a decent amount of sun on your balcony. So, find the sunniest spot and put most of your plants there. Besides, putting your plants up (on top of the air conditioner unit, a table, shelves, etc.) helps to maximise their exposure to the sun. See Jon’s Growing a Balcony Garden article for more tips on that.\n\nIf you have very little sun, you may not be able to grow much, therefore look for alternative places you could grow your vegetables in. Why not ask a friend or work colleague if they have a spare patch of land they are not using?\n\nYou can also look into renting a community garden.\n\nFor example in Tokyo, the application information is usually printed in local city newspapers in early January. These newspapers can be picked up from city halls, libraries, train stations, and other public facilities.\n\nYou then need to follow the application procedures and winners are then drawn by lottery. People are usually notified in February. Community gardens typically open in mid-March, and rental periods end on January 31st the following year.\n\nNote that the above are guidelines and may differ by district and city.\n\nIf you are not proficient in Japanese, don’t let this prevent you from applying and ask a Japanese friend to help you with the application.\n\n2/ Get some soil and a pot \n\nStart small with one pot or planter box and expand onward and upward from there. Get ready to make mistakes! Initially, growing food involves a lot of trial and error. You will quickly learn what methods do and do not work, and where ideal places are to grow plants. \n\nYou can get some soil from any home store or alternatively use some compost. The darker the soil, the better as it will have more nutrients for the plants.\n\nYou will make mistakes and have seeds not sprout and plants not grow but don’t let failure stop you from trying.\n3/",

No urban patio is too small to house an array of seasonal flowers and plants that flourish in the colder months and can bring some green into your life.\n\nIn the traditional Japanese calendar, the 15 days following Jan. 20 are deemed the coldest time of the year, the last and most harsh period of winter: daikan (period of extreme cold). Yet, within this chill are slivers of botanical awakenings: the daffodils start to bloom and in Western Japan, plum blossoms begin to adorn the trees.\n\nIndeed, late winter is a great time to put extra effort into your balcony garden! When I spent my first winter in Japan, I was amazed by the flowers and plants which weather the cold and keep gardens and parks alive-looking even on the chilliest days. I soon learned that, unlike my native Canada, I could cultivate a garden year-round if I rotated plants seasonally. In this time of year, there are two main jobs to be done: choosing and planting seeds indoors for eventual transplanting in spring and keeping your balcony green and flowery with seasonal favorites. \n\nPlanting Seeds for Spring\n© Photo by Elizabeth Sok\n\nSome of our many seedlings on their first day.\n\nChoosing and planting seeds is an exciting project for our family. Everyone has an opinion about what should have a place of honor on our small balcony. We procure our seeds in three ways. First, my eldest daughter has been putting aside fruit and vegetable seeds for the last little while, especially sweet mikan and juicy lemons, that we will try to sprout. We also have a stash of seeds from last year’s most successful plants. And, there is always much joy in buying seeds at the nearest home center (more on this below).\n\n© Photo by Elizabeth Sok\n\nAfter sprouting!\n\nEarly February is largely our planning stage and mid-February is when we start planting seedlings indoors, but of course, this depends on where you live in Japan. First, buy seedling pots (or a kit) and fill them with seed starting soil (we purchased ours on Amazon). If you want to avoid plastic, you can make your own pots using paper towels or toilet paper tubes, newspaper or yogurt cups to achieve the desired small pots for your seeds. Then, evenly distribute a few of your chosen seeds into the pots (not all of the seeds may germinate). If the seeds are too small, metal tweezers can help pick them up carefully. For kids, aim for bigger seeds, like sunflowers or beans, which are easier to handle. Don’t put them too deeply under the soil or they won’t receive enough sunlight. A light covering of soil is perfect. The seeds also need to be warm so place them in a place with lots of sunlight.\n\nIf you purchase a se",

So it's up to us to instigate change by cutting our own greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and as much as possible. Here are a few simple things you can do in your everyday Japan life.\n\nAlthough we tend to picture big industries as our largest polluters, the truth is that in Tokyo only, the residential sector was the second-highest carbon-emitting sector in fiscal 2014, standing at 32%, just behind the commercial division at 36%. Both of those sectors are in an increasing trend, as the latest data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Bureau of Environment shows.\n\nIn the outcome of the devastating March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, Tokyoites were able to demonstrate how a conscious shift in their habits can make an impact — electricity demand in the region dropped significantly after damage to nuclear power plants in Fukushima following the quake led to calls for broad-based energy conservation. But now, almost seven years later, many of us are back to where we were before. It’s time to get more cautious and start doing more. Here are ten simple tips you can immediately incorporate into your daily life and help make a change. \n\n1. Stick To Cool Biz, Warm Biz\n\nSince 2005, Japan’s environment ministry has been running its annual Cool Biz campaign, asking people to aim for a summertime room temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, while its winter Warm Biz approach calls for offices and homes to target 20 degrees. The campaign further advises practicing kazoku danran, or family members spending time together. If the family is all in the same room, you only have to heat (or cool) one place. Two birds with one stone!\n\n2. Turn off your toilet seat heater\n\nThe heated toilet seat is probably our favorite modern Japanese gadget, but as much as we love it, overusing it is not good for the environment. You can avoid a cold-seat shock by instead using a cloth toilet seat cover, which you can buy in all department stores and even 100-yen stores across the country.\n\nIt’s up to us to instigate change by cutting our own greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and as much as possible.\n\n3. Use floor heating wisely\n\nMany modern Japanese homes have their living and dining room floors heated by water running through pipes underneath the floorboards, known in Japan as yuka danbo. Since this system’s biggest cost is the initial heating of that water, to save electricity don’t turn it off if you’re only nipping out of the house briefly. The floor will remain warm for about an hour after being turned off, so hit the switch earlier at ",

Here are some key perspectives that can make all the difference in your approach to health.\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to ask a large group of foreign women living in Tokyo if they usually research health information in English (or their native language), Japanese or both. It was almost unanimous that they researched health tips in English, even if they had a good understanding of Japanese. I found this to be interesting because Japan has such a different culture around food. Tailoring Western advice to an Asian lifestyle seemed a bit redundant, especially with the differences between Japanese and Western diet approaches.\n\nReading an article from someone living in the United States while living in Japan makes me feel like I have to search for uncommon Western health foods, like quinoa and kale. I also feel like I have to scout out a green juice shop that opens before breakfast hours or figure out a way to bake foods when it’s not that common in Japan to even own an oven. So, for this article, I felt inspired to share the exact differences between the Japanese and Western diet approaches. I hope to give you a new perspective and raise your confidence in Eastern methods.\n\n1. The Japanese Diet Is Broad, While The Western Diet Is Detailed\n2. The Japanese Diet Includes A Variety Of Everything\n3. The Japanese Diet Combines Foods To Optimize Digestion\n4. Hydration In The West Is Achieved Mainly Through Water\n5. Japanese People Don’t Drink Much Water With Meals\n1. The Japanese Diet Is Broad, While The Western Diet Is Detailed\n© Photo by iStock: karinsasaki\n\nThere was a time when we didn’t have “diet science” to help us explain what was nutritionally sound for our bodies. In the East (countries like Japan, China and India), people developed a way of looking at nature for clues on how to stay healthy and how to rebalance ailments in the body.\n\nEat Seasonally\n\nThe most obvious one would be to eat according to the seasons. The idea is that the earth offers us exactly what we need to acclimate our bodies to our climate. You’ll easily notice this in a Japanese teishoku (set meals). While the main set is the same throughout the year, with some animal or vegetarian protein, vegetables, rice, soup and pickles, the vegetables are always interchanged as the seasons change.\n\nOther broad attributes of the Japanese diet would be considering things like:\n\nHow fast or slow foods digest in our body.\nWhether they make us feel uplifted or relaxed.\nIf the foods cause our body to contract or to expand.\n\nIn other words, they look at properties you can understand with your s",

That means it's almost Children's Day in Japan!\n\nKodomo No Hi (Children’s Day) in Japan is a vibrant national holiday dedicated to children. It is celebrated annually on May 5th (or “double fifth”) during the Golden Week holidays. To the untrained eye, fish swimming in the sky may seem like an odd affair—colorful carp-shaped flags hoisted from balconies and ominous-looking samurai armor adorn family living rooms. Let us fill you in on this traditional public holiday in Japan!\n\nKodomo No Hi: Back To The Origins\n© Photo by iStock: rssfhs\n\nDuring the Nara period (710 to 794), May 5th was known as Tango no sekku (端午の節句), a day for women to purify the house and rest their bodies. This was due to May being the rice planting season—a sacred time of year, as many believed they had to welcome the rice god to pray for a bountiful harvest. Young women called “Saotome“, sacred beings of the time, were in charge of planting the rice and had to purify themselves as they were the ones welcoming the god of the rice fields.\n\nHowever, during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), as the samurai class took control of the government, the day was changed to celebrate young boys instead. In 1948, the government changed the official name to Kodomo No Hi to celebrate all children, but even today, the day continues to involve traditional customs of its samurai origins.\n\nMost Japanese people still consider and celebrate the day as Boys’ Day. This does seem only fair as there is a Girl’s Day (Hinamatsuri) celebrated on March 3rd or “double third”—though Girl’s Day is not an official public holiday.\n\nHow Do You Celebrate Children’s Day in Japan?\n© Photo by iStock: TATSUSHI TAKADA\nThe Armor & The Beetle\n\nFamilies celebrating Kodomo no Hi will decorate their homes with samurai armor and helmet miniatures, representing their wishes to raise strong boys. The armor (yoroi, 鎧) and helmet (kabuto, 兜) form the word yoroikabuto, which you will hear often around this time of the year.\n\n© Photo by iStock: Toru Kimura\n\nThose of you studying Japanese may find a useful mnemonic in the word for the helmet—kabuto—which sounds an awful lot like the kabutomushi (Japanese stag beetle) and in my eyes bears more than a passing resemblance. The kabuto was the inspiration behind Darth Vader’s helmet and the traditional versions still retain a sense of that menace.\n\nThe Carp Symbolism\n\nHouseholds with boys will also hoist fierce and colorful carp flags outside their homes, and you can witness the same in various public places across the country.\n\nThe annual Children’s Day Festival at Tokyo Tower oversees hundreds of c",

Start planning those day trips early with our guide to the best family-friendly aquariums in Japan.\n\nThe good thing about living in Japan is that there are so many amazing aquariums. What makes aquarium trips so awesome is that you can enjoy seeing marine life without getting soaked (unless you sit in the splash zone at a show). Aquariums are also great places to visit anytime, whatever the weather. Best of all, these water worlds can spark the imagination and give you and your family a much-needed mental break.\n\nWith so many aquariums to choose from in Japan, which one do you pick? How do you make the best choice for you and your family? Here are some considerations to help narrow down the field so you can plan the best day trip ever!\n\nHow Big Are You Thinking?\nSmaller Aquariums\nIndoor & Outdoor Aquariums\nBigger Aquariums\nHow Kid-Friendly Is It?\nAquariums With Underwater Tunnels\nAre You Looking for One-Of-A-Kind Experiences?\nEntertainment Packed\nCool Aesthetics\nMarine Lovers Of All Kinds\nSpecific Marine Life Exhibits\nConsider the Costs\nUnder ¥1,000\nUnder ¥3,000\n¥3,000+\nHow Big Are You Thinking?\n© Photo by iStock: EyeEm Mobile GmbH\n\nWhen it comes to visiting aquariums with babies and young kids, bigger isn’t always better.\n\nSmaller Aquariums\n\nLittle kiddos tend to get tired and overwhelmed quickly so think about how big you want to go. With tiny humans in mind, smaller aquariums are your best bet:\n\nSumida Aquarium, Tokyo\nMaxell Aqua Park Shinagawa, Tokyo\nSunshine Aquarium, Tokyo\nNumazu Deep Sea Aquarium, Shizuoka\n\nIf you choose a smaller aquarium, your little one can marvel at the fishies for as long as he or she wants. That being said, take frequent breaks to avoid major meltdowns. Also, consider if the aquarium is stroller-friendly, with wide paths for maneuvering when it gets crowded during peak times.\n\nIndoor & Outdoor Aquariums\n\nIf small spaces are too much for your kid, choose aquariums with a mix of outdoor and indoor venues. For instance, Enoshima Aquarium in Kanagawa and Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa have a mix of spaces and both aquariums are located near the seashore.\n\nBigger Aquariums\n\nIf your child is older and can handle bigger spaces, the world is your oyster:\n\nKamogawa Sea World, Chiba\nKaiyukan, Osaka\nOkinawa Churaumi Aquarium, Okinawa\nPort of Nagoya Public Aquarium, Nagoya\nHow Kid-Friendly Is It?\n© Photo by iStock: damircudic\n\nNothing spoils a trip more than one when you have to constantly tell your kid, “Don’t touch that! You can’t go there!” When it comes to aquariums and the little ones, it’s all about creating the ultimate sensory experience. Choose aquariums wi",

The phrase was coined by the renowned German-American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and it suggests that “keeping things simple and clear leads to better results than making them complex and cluttered”.\n\nIn addition to having influenced architecture, this idea has also influenced graphic design, product design, interior design, and other design fields where the quest for clarity and simplicity continues to inspire creative and classic works.\n\nTherefore, one could argue that “if the term was invented, it might not be an original idea but rather a style or pattern that an architect from the past enjoyed employing, and since then, many other architects and designers have adopted it due to its elegance and simplicity, am I correct?! Before you counter this, keep in mind that humans created every principle we study today.\n\nA better way to phrase our popular design adage, “Less is more,” would be “minimalist design”. I am sure 90% of designers have heard of this term. While maximalist design is the opposite of this style of design.\n\nMinimalism stresses simplicity, purity, and functionality, whereas maximalism welcomes complexity, extravagance, and richness. It resembles being rough yet attractive more.\n\nI feel like maximalism can be related to rough guys. Even though they are rough, ladies still find them attractive. Are we still discussing design? 😂 But I think you ",
